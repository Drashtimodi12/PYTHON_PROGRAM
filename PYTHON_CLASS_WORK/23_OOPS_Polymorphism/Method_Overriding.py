# Method overriding occurs when a child class (subclass) provides a specific implementation of a method that 
# is already defined in its parent class (superclass).

# In simple words:- Same method name in both parent and child classes.
# Child class modifies or changes the behavior of the parent class method.



# class A:
#     def disp(self):
#         print("Class A disp method calling")

# class B(A):
#     def disp(self):
#         print("Class B disp method calling")

# # Create an instance of class B
# b = B()
# # Call the disp method
# b.disp()

# # Output:
# # Class B disp method calling


# Parent class
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal is speaking")

# Child class
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog is barking")

# Create object of Dog
d = Dog()
d.speak()  # Output: Dog is barking
