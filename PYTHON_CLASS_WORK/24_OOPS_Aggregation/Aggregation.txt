Aggregation is a concept in object-oriented programming where one class is used as a part of another class but 
still exists independently. It represents a "has-a" relationship, where one class contains a reference to another 
class. The lifetime of the contained object is not strictly dependent on the lifetime of the container object. 
This means that the contained object can exist independently of the container object.
