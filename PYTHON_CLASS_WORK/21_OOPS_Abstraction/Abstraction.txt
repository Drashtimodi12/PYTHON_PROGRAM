Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of OOP. It is the concept of hiding 
the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. The main aim of abstraction 
is to separate the interface from the implementation, allowing the user to interact with the object without needing 
to understand the internal workings.

It is achieved in Python using abstract classes and abstract methods.
